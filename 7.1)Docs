#TREE IMPLEMENTED

We have implemented a simple binary tree and Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order traversals and size and kth level methods.
We have entered values manually.
The tree looks like:    1
                     2     3
                    4 5   6 7
We have also implemented a function to make a tree given preorder and inorder traversals of a tree.
