#TREE IMPLEMENTED

We have implemented a simple binary tree and Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order traversals, Top view, size and kth level methods.
We also have spiral traversal method and a height method that gives diameter as well.
Size of a tree is number of nodes. We have a special method for complete tree size with optimization.
Spiral Traversal is simply level order traversal with each alternate level printed in reverse.
Diameter of a tree is the maximum number of nodes on a path from one leaf to other.
Height of a tree is the number of levels it has.
Top view is printing nodes from left to right that are visible from the top, assuming each node hides all nodes on same vertical
level as it, same vertical level is determined by the horizotal distance from root.
We have entered values manually.
The tree looks like:    1
                     2     3
                    4 5   6 7
We have also implemented a function to make a tree given preorder and inorder traversals of a tree.
