#TREE IMPLEMENTED

We have implemented a simple binary tree and Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order traversals and size and kth level methods.
We also have spiral trversal ethod and a height method that gives diameter as well.
Size of a tree is number of nodes.
Spiral Traversal is simply level order traversal with each alternate level printed in reverse.
Diameter of a tree is the maximum number of nodes on a path from one leaf to other.
Height of a tree is the number of levels it has.
We have entered values manually.
The tree looks like:    1
                     2     3
                    4 5   6 7
We have also implemented a function to make a tree given preorder and inorder traversals of a tree.
