#Stack

We have implemented stack using array and made push, pop and delete options. 
We have also used that data structure to solve balance paranthesis problem.\

The stack is dynamically sized and thus there is no problem of overflow.
The pop method takes an optional parameter "ret", which if set to True will return the removed element as well otherwise not.
We have made a topElement method as it is helpful in our function.

The function takes in a string consisting of only brackets and returns if the string has equal number of opening and closing brackets
and each bracket opened is closed by the same corresponding bracket and in the same opening order. ex: "[]{([])}" is balanced but 
"{[(])}" is not.
