#Queue Implementation

We have implemented the queue using circular array to make all operations in O(1) time.

We have implemented python collections module deque to solve maximum element in contiguous subarray problem.
The problem is to find the maximum element for each contiguous subarray of size k(where k is given) and return them as array.
For ex: arr=[1,2,3,2,3,6] and k=3 will have answer array as [3,3,3,6], the four sub arrays will be [1,2,3], [2,3,2], [3,2,3] and [2,3,6].
