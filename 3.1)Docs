#HASH TABLE IMPEMENTATION

We have implemented hash table in python using chaining for collision handling.

The class created has to be initialized with the number to be used as modulo to covert into indices.
We have limited to max 5 elements to be stored on same index chain.
A better lookup table is implemented in python(dictionaries) but we did this for concepts.
