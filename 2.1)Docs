#STRING MANIPULATIONS

The string.py file contain some string manipulation functions
--Checking for Lexicographic rank.
--Checking if all letters occus same number of times.
--Checking for speacial substrings(special palindrome for odd length and same character string for even).
--Finding longest substring that is also a palindrome.
--Anagrams making.
--Finding Length of longest common subsequence.
--Rabin Karp Algo with rolling Hash.
--LPS array computing.
--KMP algorithm.
--Steady Gene(Taking a string of length 4n made up of only "A", "C", "T" and "G" and returning the length of smallest substring that has to 
  be replaced to make the occurence of each letter = n)
