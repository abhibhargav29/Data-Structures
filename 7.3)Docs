#TREE IMPLEMENTED

7.0) We have implemented a simple binary tree and Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order traversals, Top view, size and kth level methods.
We also have spiral traversal method and a height method that gives diameter as well.
--Size of a tree is number of nodes. We have a special method for complete tree size with optimization.
--Spiral Traversal is simply level order traversal with each alternate level printed in reverse.
--Diameter of a tree is the maximum number of nodes on a path from one leaf to other.
--Height of a tree is the number of levels it has.
--Top view is printing nodes from left to right that are visible from the top, assuming each node hides all nodes below it and on 
same vertical level as it, same vertical level is determined by the horizotal distance from root.
We have entered values manually.
We have also implemented a function to make a tree given preorder and inorder traversals of a tree.

7.1)We have implemented the binary search tree using a BST class. It has methods for search, insert, delete and level order traversal.
It also has floor and ceil methods that are basically extensions of search method.
Floor finds the value inside tree that is smaller than given value and closest to it, it gives -1 for not present.
Ceil finds the value inside tree that is greater than given value and closest to it, it gives -1 for not present.
The complexity of all these operatns in O(h) except traversal.
A balancd BST will have all of them as O(logn).

7.2)Here we have implemented the balanced Binary search tree AVL. It is one of very strict tree and it has complex insertion and deletions
to maintain this strict balancing.

7.3)Trie
